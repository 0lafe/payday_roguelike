This means you will deal with more random drops, random heists, and much less control over your builds\n\nThere are a few changes you will notice off the bat. All perk decks have been removed in favor of copycat. You will slowly unlock cards you can use for the deck to boost your power. These aren't the vanilla cards, but rather a collection of vanilla-esuqe abilities you can pick from\n\nInstead of buying weapons, you will obtain them from completing missions. Most will give you a handful of weapons, as well as weapon mods",
